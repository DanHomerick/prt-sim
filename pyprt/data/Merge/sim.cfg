[Switch]
# A scenario can be simulated as though the switching mechanism resides in the

# messages the controller uses. When the switching is performed by the track,
# it is modeled as taking some time to transition from one line to the other.
# The following are the amounts of time required between when the command is
# received and when the nose of the vehicle can safely reach the beginning of
# the branch point. Values are in seconds.
