# The track is a simple bidirectional loop with no way for a vehicle to reach the other direction.
# That is, the vehicle's can't turn around. Stations 0 and 1 are connected to the 'forward' ring,
# and Stations 2 and 3 are connected to the 'reverse' ring.
#
# In this version of the passenger file, no passengers have a destination station that cannot
# be reached from their origin station.
